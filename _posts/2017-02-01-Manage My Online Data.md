General sites to manage the data Google stores on you.

- https://www.google.com/maps/timeline
Explore all your Google location data on a map and over time. Pretty crazy if you zoom into the city where you live.

- https://www.history.google.com/history
This used to be a site where you could view your search trends over time, like which sites you navigated to the most or what your weekly search patterns looked like. It was really cool, but it doesn't seem to exist anymore.
