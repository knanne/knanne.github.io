# Data Prep

## Tabula

[Tabula](http://tabula.technology/) is a handy tool to extract data from PDF files.

> If you’ve ever tried to do anything with data provided to you in PDFs, you know how painful this is — you can’t easily copy-and-paste rows of data out of PDF files. Tabula allows you to extract that data in CSV format, through a simple web interface. [website](http://tabula.technology/)

# Programming

## Rodeo

[Rodeo](https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo) is a nice Python IDE, basically RStudio for Python.

> Rodeo is a development environment that’s lightweight and intuitive, yet customizable to its core - your own personal home base for exploring and interpreting data. - [website](https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo)
