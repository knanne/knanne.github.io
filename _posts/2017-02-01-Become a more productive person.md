Notes on how to become more productive person, and some helpful tools

<!-- excerpt separator -->

## The X Effect

I'm not sure where this originated, but the [internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1x99m6/im_a_piece_of_shit_no_more_games_no_more_lies_no/cf9dz72/) has decided that streaks of X's on cards are the most effective way to start or break habits. The effect seems to work similarly for starting new habits.

This method has also been credited to Jerry Sienfeld according to [this article](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret) from 2007.

> He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. "After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain." - Brad Isaac

- So a subreddit was born [/r/theXeffect](http://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect)
- And some scholar came up with [fortyninedays.com](https://www.fortyninedays.com), although it seems it may be [disappearing soon](https://www.fortyninedays.com/Post/View/58)

#### Popular (Android) Apps Employing The Method

Whether you are tracking Habits, Tasks, Goals, Activities or Achievements many apps now use this "X" chain or streak method to motivate more accomplishments.

#### Simulating The X Effect in Google Calendar

- add recurring [To Dos](https://blog.google/products/calendar/add-to-dos-to-your-google-calendar/) (e.g. pay bills) in Google Calendar

- add [Goals](https://blog.google/products/calendar/find-time-goals-google-calendar/) (e.g. workout) in Google Calendar

- use [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) to manage lists of single-occurrence tasks (e.g. fix this) and associate a reminder in Google Calendar

The UI of Google Calendar does not provide the best view of tracking X's over time, but it does offer Goals and To Dos in addition to normal events and crosses out those that have been marked as done, and reschedules those that have been dismissed

## Time Tracking

Time tracking is another effective way to keep yourself on task and make sure to get the important things done before diverging down a rabbit hole of internet links
