Some notes from my daily software use (currently on Windows)

<!-- excerpt separator -->

## Cmder

> Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows. It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout, looking sexy from the start.

I'm not sure I can say anything more...just [download it](http://cmder.net/)

Favorite commands:
  - summons from taskbar with ``Ctrl+` ``

## Text Editor

- previously used [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- currently using [Atom](https://atom.io/) which seems pretty magical

Both of these options offer packages to enhance various languages (autocompletion, linting)  

#### Atom

It's made by the guys at GitHub so it has some fancy native integrations. Refer to the [Atom Flight Manual](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/) for basic documentation.

Here are a few notable takeaways:
- Press `Alt` key to unhide auto-hidden menu  
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` opens the command palette  

Packages I use include:  
- [autocomplete-python](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python)

## Python for Data Analysis

#### Jupyter Notebook

[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) (Formerly IpythonNotebook) now supports everything you would ever need for data analysis and visualization, even with interactive charts for some libraries.

#### Rodeo

[Rodeo](https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo) is basically RStudio, but of course for Python. Which means it's pretty dope.
