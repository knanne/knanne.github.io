## The X Effect

I'm not sure where this originated, but the [internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1x99m6/im_a_piece_of_shit_no_more_games_no_more_lies_no/cf9dz72/) has decided that streaks of X's on cards are the most effective way to start or break habits.

This method has also been credited to Jerry Sienfeld according to [this article](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret) from 2007.

- So a subreddit was born [/r/theXeffect](http://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect)
- And some scholar came up with [fortyninedays.com](https://www.fortyninedays.com), although it seems it may be [disappearing soon](https://www.fortyninedays.com/Post/View/58)

#### Popular (Android) Apps Employing The Method

Whether you are tracking Habits, Tasks, Goals, Activities or Achievements many apps now use this "X" chain or streak method to motivate more accomplishments.

## Simulating The X Effect in Google Calendar

- add recurring [To Dos](https://blog.google/products/calendar/add-to-dos-to-your-google-calendar/) (e.g. pay bills) in Google Calendar

- add [Goals](https://blog.google/products/calendar/find-time-goals-google-calendar/) (e.g. workout) in Google Calendar

- use [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) to manage lists of single-occurrence tasks (e.g. fix this) and associate a reminder in Google Calendar

The UI of Google Calendar does not provide the best view of tracking X's over time, but it does cross out the Goals and To Dos that have been marked as done, and deletes those that have been dismissed - so i find it effective
