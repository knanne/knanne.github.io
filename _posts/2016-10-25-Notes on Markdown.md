Notes on how to use Markdown

## Markdown Intro  

- read GitHub's [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)  
- download the [cheatsheet.pdf](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)  

<div class="heading" id="render_markdown"></div>  

## Render Markdown  

If you want to write in markdown locally, for example when writing posts for a blog, it helps to be able to see live previews on your changes.

The best way I have found is to utilize a native [markdown-preview package](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) in Atom text editor.

I have tried [markdownpad](https://markdownpad.com/), and this [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview-plus/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl)
