Notes on using windows for development.

<!-- excerpt separator -->

## windows command prompt

```shell
# dir info  
dir

# show entire tree of subfolders  
tree

# list files and subfolders  
dir /b

# list all files in subfolders  
dir /s
```

Alternatively, I use [cmder](http://cmder.net/) on windows because it supports unix commands (and it just looks dope).
